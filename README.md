## Features

- **Password-protected links**: Encrypt any URL with a password. Only those with the password can unlock it.
- **Hidden/disguised bookmarks**: Create bookmarks that look like any site, but secretly point to your encrypted link.
- **Client-side cryptography**: All encryption/decryption happens in your browser. No data is sent to any server.
- **Modern, responsive UI**: Works beautifully on desktop and mobile.
- **No sign-up, no tracking, no ads**: 100% privacy-focused.

## How It Works

1. **Encrypt a Link**: Enter a URL and password. LinkVault generates a secure, encrypted link you can share.
2. **Decrypt a Link**: Paste an encrypted link and enter the password to unlock the original URL.
3. **Hidden Bookmarks**: Disguise your encrypted link as a bookmark to any site (e.g., "Gmail"). Only you know the secret.

All cryptography uses the [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) and strong AES-GCM encryption.
